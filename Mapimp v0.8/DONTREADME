• What is this?
This is an OllyDbg plugin which will help you to import
map files exported by IDA, Dede, IDR, Microsoft and Borland
linkers

• Why?
There are many plugins using which you can perform similar
actions, but mapimp:
- Recognizes debugged file segments and applies names correctly
- Has an option to overwrite or skip names that intersect already defined
- Has a filter option which gives you great name demangling potential
- Works fast (but who cares nowadays, right?)

• How to install?
If you ask this question you probably don't need this software

• How to use?
"Import map" menu item guides you to the file pick dialog. Pick the map
file you want to import and be happy
"Options" menu item guides you to the options dialog (thank you, captain Obvious)

- Import objects
There are two objects you can import: comments and labels. Nothing interesting here

- Collisions
Check "Skip if collision" to protect already defined names from being overwritten.
Check "Overwrite" otherwise

- Apply names to
Check "Viewed module" to apply names to module you are currently viewing in a disassembler
window. It is useful if you want to work with the library which is linked to your debuggee.
Check "Debuggee" and whatever EIP you are the names will be applied to the module adequate to
the file of your debugging session

- If map file found
When new session starts mapimp searches for DEBUGGEE_FILE_PATH\DEBUGGEE_FILE_NAME.MAP
and proposes to load it right away. Of course not everyone want to see the annoing message
so the feature is optional

- Filter
The main idea is to apply series of masks to every single name loaded. Mask syntax goes as follows:

/key[/]regex

Key "c" cuts the matched substring selected by regular expression

[SAMPLE]
name:     System::__linkproc__ GetMem(int)
mask:     /c__linkproc__ 
applied:  System::GetMem(int)
[/SAMPLE]

Key "s" skips the name if regular expression succeeds. It may be useful if you 
want to skip some dummy or incorrect names

[SAMPLE]
name:     unknown_libname_2519
mask:     /sunknown_libname_
applied:
[/SAMPLE]

Key "r" replaces the substring selected by regular expression with your own

/rsubstring/regex

As you can see slash character delims your substring from the regular expression.
Use double slash to define slash as a character of your substring

[SAMPLE]
name:     System@Function(System@AnsiString;System@AnsiString)
mask:     /rsys::/System@
applied:  sys::Function(sys::AnsiString;sys::AnsiString)

name:     System@Function(System@AnsiString;System@AnsiString)
mask:     /r//_/@
applied:  System/_Function(System/_AnsiString;System/_AnsiString)
[/SAMPLE]

Remember that if the name met mask condition it will be changed, then the
second mask is applied to the changed name and so on. The order of mask applying
is adequate to the order of appearance in the list

As about regular expressions, the plugin uses pcre library which syntax is
compatible with perl regular expressions. Check http://www.pcre.org for docs and
sources

For adding, editing and other actions you can perform with masks use mask manager's 
context menu

Before being processed by mask filter names may be demangled. Microsoft and
Borland mangling schemes are supported and only names are undecorated. If map
file contains already demangled names the feature is ignored. Check "Demangle names"
to enable

• Keyboard shortcuts
Since version 0.3 keyboard shortcuts are availible

- From OllyDbg main window
Ctrl + Shift + I    Import map file
Ctrl + Shift + M    Options

- From mapimp options window
Ctrl + A       Add new mask
Ctrl + I       Insert new mask
Ctrl + E       Edit mask
Ctrl + S       Save mask list
Ctrl + L       Load mask list
Ctrl + Up      Move mask upwards
Ctrl + Down    Move mask downwards
Ctrl + PgUp    Move mask to the beginning
Ctrl + PgDown  Move mask to the end
Enter          Apply
Esc            Cancel

Also window control accelerator is availible. Use Alt + underscored letter to interact

• How to compile?
To compile the plugin by yourself you need pcre library sources and OllyDbg PDK 1.10.
For how to compile pcre library on win32 refer to the document called "NON-UNIX-USE" from
pcre sources package. "BUILDING PCRE ON WINDOWS WITH CMAKE" paragraph contains step-by-step
guide up to what button should you press next. When you get all libs pile them near the
plugin's source files, create a project using your favourite ide (i've used msvc 8), configure
the compiler for best output's performance, press build button and be happy

• Contacts
If you found a bug or you have some suggestions, please, let me know.
But don't even try to ask me for missing libs or units. They could easily
be found on the web

Enter and compile, in a place we are the force!!
