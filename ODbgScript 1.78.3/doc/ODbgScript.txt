1. About ODbgScript
-------------------
ODbgScript is a plugin for OllyDbg, which is, in our opinion, 
the best application-mode debugger out there. One of the best 
features of this debugger is the plugin architecture which allows 
users to extend its functionality. ODbgScript is a plugin 
meant to let you automate OllyDbg by writing scripts in an 
assembly-like language. Many tasks involve a lot of repetitive 
work just to get to some point in the debugged application. By 
using this plugin you can write a script once and for all. 

------------------------------

2. Status
----------------------------

v1.54
ODbgScript has a new site and SVN system : http://odbgscript.sf.net

v1.0
OllyScript becomes ODbgScript with the new GUI Windows

v0.9
OllyScript has now been downloaded more then 10000 times! That means more then 2Gb of raw
scripting power flowing down the optic cable veins of the Internet. Not bad if you ask me!
The development of the plugin has been a bit slow, I've got a job programming xray systems
which has taken a lot of time. Sorry about that.

------------------------------

3. Documentation
----------------
Example script (sample.osc) is available with this release. 
The script will break on LoadLibrary call to debug a SHELL32.DLL function. 
Try it on mspaint.exe

3.1 Language
------------
The scripting language of OllyScript is an assembly-like language.

In the document below, src and dest can be (unless stated otherwise):
 - Constant in the form of a hex number without prefixes and suffixes, with leading 0 (i.e. 00FF, not 0x00FF or 00FFh)
   For decimal values, use the point (i.e. 100. 128.)
 - Variable previously declared by VAR, or are declared with MOV
 - A 32-bit registers (one of EAX, EBX, ECX, EDX, ESI, EDI, EBP, ESP, EIP).
   A 16-bit register (one of AX, BX, CX, DX, SI, DI, BP, SP)
   A 8-bit register (one of AL, AH, ... DL, DH)
 - A memory reference in square brackets (i.e. [401000] points to the memory at address 401000, 
	[ecx] points to the memory at address ecx).
 - A flag with an exclamation mark in front (one of !CF, !PF, !AF, !ZF, !SF, !DF, !OF)
 - Sometimes byte strings are required. Those are scripted as #6A0000# (values between two #) and 
	must have an even number of characters.
   Some byte strings can contain the wildcard '?', for example #6A??00# or #6?0000#
 - A combination of these values with operators:

You can use operators in your scripts, +-*/&|^>< for dword and + to concatenate strings.
 - Operators > and < are shr and shl (>> and << in C/C++)
 - Operator ^ is XOR 
 - Operator & is AND
 - Operator | is OR

3.1.1 Reserved variables
------------------------

$RESULT
-------
Return value for some functions like FIND etc.
$RESULT_1 and $RESULT_2 are available for some commands.

$VERSION
--------
Contains current version of OllyScript
Example
	cmp $VERSION, "0.8"
	ja version_above_08

3.1.2 Commands
--------------

#INC file
---------
Include a script file in another script file
Example:
	#inc "anotherscript.txt"
	
#LOG
----
Enable logging of executed commands.
The commands will appear in OllyDbg log window, and will be prefixed with -->
Example:
	#log

ADD dest, src
-------------
Adds src to dest and stores result in dest
Example: 
	add x, 0F
	add eax, x
	add [401000], 5
	add y, " times" // If y was 1000 before this command then y is "1000 times" after it

AI
--
Execute "Animate into" in OllyDbg
Example:
	ai

ALLOC size
----------
Allocate new memory page, you can read/write and execute.
Example
    alloc 1000
	free $RESULT, 1000

AN addr
-------
Analyze module which contains the address addr.
Example:
	an eip // Same as pressing CTRL-A

AND dest, src
-------------
AND's src and dest and stores result in dest
Example: 
	and x, 0F
	and eax, x
	and [401000], 5

AO
--
Executes "Animate over" in OllyDbg
Example:
	ao

ASK question
------------
Display an input box with the specified question and lets user enter a response.
Sets the reserved $RESULT variable (0 if cancel button was pressed).
You have also the length in $RESULT_1 (divided by 2 for hex entries)
Example:
	ask "Enter new EIP"
	cmp $RESULT, 0
	je cancel_pressed
	mov eip, $RESULT
	
ASM addr, command [,version]
----------------------------
Assemble a command at some address. 
Change version number (0,1,...) to get alternative code bytes, if possible.
Returns bytes assembled in the reserved $RESULT variable
Example:
	asm eip, "mov eax, ecx"

ASMTXT addr, file
-----------------
Assemble a text asm file at some address.
Example:
	asmtxt EIP, "myasm.txt"

ATOI str [, base=16.]
-----------------
Convert a string to integer
Returns the integer in the reserved $RESULT variable
Example:
	atoi "F"
	atoi "10", 10.

BACKUP addr [,base,size]
------------------------
Like OPENDUMP, create a Dump Window with data at address.
But this dump window keeps a backup of data, which can be used to view changes
$RESULT is the HWND of window, for future use
Note: If you are looking to save data in a file, see the DM function (Dump Memory)
Example:
	BACKUP esp
	STO
	STO

BC [addr]
---------
Clear unconditional breakpoint at addr.
Without parameter, the command clears all loaded breakpoints 
Example:

BD [addr]
---------
Disable breakpoint at addr.
Without parameter, the command disables all loaded breakpoints 
Example:

GAPI addr #BETA#
---------
## Chinese Translation ## 
Obtains the code place API call information
The API information saves in preservation variable $RESULT.

$RESULT_1 save link base/storehouse (for instance kernel32)
$RESULT_2 save symbolic name (for instance ExitProcess).
$RESULT_3 save calling location (for instance call xxxxx)
$RESULT_4 save destination

Notice: This and the GN difference is GN must point to the IAT address
But GAPI gives the code address to be possible directly to obtain API
Also has, if you have gotten down the software break point in here, please first clear the break point to use this sentence again, because the software break point modified the code is CC
If here does not clear here the software break point, will create this not to be able the very good recognition.
Example:
	GAPI 401000 (call kernel32.ExitProcess)
	GAPI the EIP // examined whether the current code is API calls, is not then returns to 0

Example:
	ti

TICK [var [,reftime]]
---------------------
Set variable with script execution time (microsec)
if reftime parameter is set, set $RESULT with time since reftime.
if no parameter is set, function set $RESULT with execution time in text, in "<ssss mmm> ms" format
var is declared automatically.
Example:
	tick time
	msg time		//time since script startup
	tick time,time	
	msg $RESULT		//time since last TICK, DWORD value

- About: shows information about this plugin

3.5 Script Window
-----------------
The Script Window was introduced with ODbgScript, it enables you to debug
and see progression of your script.
You can set script breakpoints, debug the script, edit variables and also 
execute commands manually.


4. Integration with other plugins
---------------------------------
You can call OllyScript from your plugin and make it execute a script.
Use something like the source code below:

HMODULE hMod = GetModuleHandle("ODbgScript.dll");
if(hMod) // Check that the other plugin is present and loaded
{
	// Get address of exported function
	int (*pFunc)(char*) = (int (*)(char*)) GetProcAddress(hMod, "ExecuteScript");
	if(pFunc) // Check that the other plugin exports the correct function
		pFunc("myscript.txt"); // Execute exported function
}

DebugScript dll entry is also available.

You can also execute script commands via OllyDBG ODBG_plugincmd() 
and in Conditional Log Breakpoints.
