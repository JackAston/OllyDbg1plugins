Uhooker v1.3
============

To install uhooker just copy:

uhooker.dll
server.py
proxy.py

to ollydbg's directory.

and that's it!.

This package contains some sample SCRIPTS in the '\scripts' directory.

Please remember that all .py files with scripts should be placed on the same directory
where 'proxy.py' and 'server.py' are, and that is the same directory where 'uhooker.dll'
is, and that is the directory where ollydbg is installed.

This is very important, otherwise the scripts won't be found by uhooker and they won't work.


so just copy everythin in '\scripts' to the ollydbg's directory (both .cfg and .py files,
although .cfg files can be anywhere).
