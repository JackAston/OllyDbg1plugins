
Whats new in uhooker v1.2?
==========================

-The communication mechanism between the ollydbg plugin and the python proxy
server has been reworked. Previously, the plugin performed a tcp connection
per breakpoint/function hooked (yes, very bad, I know), this caused
the problem that if the breakpoint/function hooked was called many many times
the system ran out of TCP sockets and everything died. Now, the ollydbg plugin
connects to the server and performs all the necessary communication between the
two using only that SINGLE connection. This eliminates the problem I mentioned
before, and also makes everything go faster.

*VERY IMPORTANT*: because of this change, previous scripts WILL NOT WORK
with this version of uhooker. Well, is not that bad. They will work,
but you need the change the following:

Previously, to obtain an instance of 'Proxy' you did the following:

def CreateFileA_handler(hookcall):
	myproxy = proxy.Proxy()

now, you have to do this:

def CreateFileA_handler(hookcall):
	myproxy = hookcall.proxy

as you can see, you no longer have to create the instance of 'Proxy', it
gets created by the server, and its passed to the handler thru the 'hookcall'
structure.  You need only to change this line and previous scripts
will work just fine.


-I added the posibility to enable and disable the plugin, if you are using the
plugin and want to stop using to debug on your own or whatever reason, now you
can do it. You can access this functinality from the Plugins->Uhooker menu.

-I fixed different issues. Probably the most important issues is that there
was a bug that prevented you to step the program being debugged when uhooker
was installed. This is fixed now.

-Besides the 'proxy' object, there is new data available from the 'hookcall' 
structure received by handlers:

hookcall.regs: registers of the debugged program. you can access them
like hookcall.regs['eax']. This was in fact available before but I think
I never documented it.

hookcall.threadid = thread id of the current thread at the moment
the handler was called

hookcall.procid = proces id of the current process at the moment
the handler was called




-I added some new functions to the plugin, some might not be working very
well, I'm in the process of fixing some issues. Even when not all the
functions are not functioning perfectly, I didn't want to take out the functions
from the release,it was more work that didn't make sense to me. If it fails,
let me know and I'll tell you what the problem is and how close I am to fix
the issue.


Some of the new functions are:

* setbreakpoint(breakaddr): there's a problem with the ollydbg GUI that makes
this function hang for some reason. I'm trying to solve this.

* changeregs(threadid, regs): this one should work fine, it changes the
registers of the thread specified in threadid.

* stepin(threadid): allows you to programtically step in the code (run one
instruction of the debugged program).


For examples on how to use these functions take a look at the documentation
page at http://oss.coresecurity.com/uhooker/doc/index.html.


There's also a new function you can use in your scripts,
normally all scripts end with a call to:

hookcall.sendack()

this returns control to uhooker (the ollydbg plugin) and uhooker
continues execution of the program being debugged. 

Now, you can also end a script with a call to

hookcall.sendacknocont()

this returns control to uhooker (the ollydbg plugin) but DOES NOT
continues the execution of the program being debugged. This is very
good for creating handlers that act as 'complex breakpoints' (among
other things), for example:

You hook CreateFile and want to stop execution of the program when 
the file 'whatever.dat' is opened. So, you can code a script
that checks if the first paremeter of CreateFile contains the
string 'whatever.dat' and if that's the case, you want to
return control to ollydbg but WITHOUT resuming execution of the program,
so you can start debugging on your own from that point on.

To do this, just call hookcall.sendacknocont() at the end of the
script, and NOT hookcall.sendack(). In this way, when the condition
is met, the program being debugged will stop its execution and you can
start debugging the program on your own.

for example:

def advapi32_regclosekey_handler(hookcall):
	print_debug( str(hex(hookcall.threadid)) )
	print_debug( str(hex(hookcall.procid)) )
	hookcall.sendacknocont()

This script will print the 'thread id' and 'process id' and
return control to the debugger every time RegCloseKey() is called.
