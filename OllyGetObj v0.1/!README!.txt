OllyGetObj 0.1

Plugin for fixing hang of olly on ZwQueryObject and GetFileType when trying to get name of some objects.
It uses the driver from handle.exe by M.Russinovich, hope he won't be offended.
Driver is signed by Sysinternals, so it shouldn't have any problems on different versions of Windows.

Usage:
1: put OllyGetObj.dll in Plugins folder
2: put the driver corresponding to your processor to ollydbg folder
3: rename it to procexp141.sys
4: enjoy
