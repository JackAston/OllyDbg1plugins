Suspicious Breakpoint Fix is a plugin for Olly 1.10 debugger.
Basically it's a cure for 2 problems:

1. Sometimes ( for example with conditional branch logger ) Olly shows the following message:

  "It looks like you are trying to set a breakpoint in the middle of some command or data.
   If this is really the case, such breakpoint will not execute and may have disastrous influence
   on the debugged program. Do you really want the set breakpoint here?"

  With this plugin you can hardcode this answer to YES/NO without pressing the button so many times.
